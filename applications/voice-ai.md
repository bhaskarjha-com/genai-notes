# Voice AI & Speech

> ✨ **Bit**: In 2024, talking to AI felt like talking to Siri â€” robotic and frustrating. By 2026, voice AI agents do customer support calls, conduct job interviews, and have natural conversations with sub-300ms latency. The interface is disappearing â€” you just talk.

---

## ★ TL;DR

- **What**: AI systems that understand speech (STT), generate speech (TTS), and enable real-time voice conversations
- **Why**: Voice is the most natural human interface. Voice AI agents are the fastest-growing GenAI application vertical. deeplearning.ai has a dedicated course on it.
- **Key point**: Modern voice AI isn't just STT→LLM→TTS glued together. End-to-end models process speech directly, achieving human-like latency and expressiveness.

---

## ★ Overview

### Definition

- **STT (Speech-to-Text)**: Converting spoken audio to text (also called ASR â€” Automatic Speech Recognition)
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**: Converting text to natural-sounding audio
- **Voice Agent**: An AI agent that converses in real-time via voice, handling turn-taking, interruptions, and context

### Scope

Covers the voice AI stack for GenAI applications. For the broader dialogue-systems view, see [Conversational AI & Dialogue Systems](./conversational-ai.md). For general multimodal AI (images, video), see [Multimodal Ai](../multimodal/multimodal-ai.md).

### STT (Speech-to-Text) Models

| Model               | By         | Languages | Key Feature                                          |

| **Whisper** (V4)    | OpenAI     | 100+      | Open-source, diarization, real-time streaming        |
| **Deepgram Nova-3** | Deepgram   | 40+       | 5.26% WER, real-time, speaker diarization            |
| **Deepgram Flux**   | Deepgram   | Multi     | Conversational AI, turn detection, ultra-low latency |

  Diarization â€” who said what ("Speaker 1: ... Speaker 2: ...")
  VAD (Voice Activity Detection) â€” detect when someone is speaking
  Streaming vs Batch â€” real-time transcription vs file processing
  Code-switching â€” handling mid-sentence language switches
```

### TTS (Text-to-Speech) Models

| Model                | By          | Latency | Key Feature                            |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **ElevenLabs**       | ElevenLabs  | ~100ms  | Best quality, voice cloning, emotional |
| **OpenAI TTS**       | OpenAI      | ~200ms  | Simple API, good quality               |
| **Google Cloud TTS** | Google      | ~150ms  | Neural2 voices, SSML                   |

| **XTTS** (Coqui)     | Open-source | Varies  | Open, multilingual                     |

```
TTS KEY CONCEPTS:
  Voice cloning â€” reproduce a specific voice from seconds of audio
  Emotional tags â€” <happy>, <serious>, <whisper> control
  SSML â€” Speech Synthesis Markup Language (pauses, emphasis)
  Prosody â€” rhythm, stress, intonation patterns
  Streaming â€” start playing audio before the full response is ready
  Zero-shot â€” generate believable voice from minutes of sample
```

### Real-Time Voice APIs

```
OPENAI REALTIME API (GPT-5.4):
  - WebSocket-based, full-duplex
  - Speech-to-speech (no intermediate text needed)
  - Sub-300ms latency
  - Interruption handling (user can cut in)
  - Function calling during voice conversation
  - Tools: search, compute, external APIs

  Architecture:
    User speaks → WebSocket → GPT-5.4 processes audio →
    Generates audio response → Streams back → User hears

## ○ Gotchas & Common Mistakes

- âš ï¸ **Cascaded latency**: STT + LLM + TTS adds up. Use end-to-end models (Realtime API) for conversational applications.
- âš ï¸ **Turn-taking is HARD**: Detecting when the user is done speaking vs pausing to think is a major UX challenge. VAD alone isn't enough.
- âš ï¸ **Voice cloning ethics**: Cloning someone's voice without consent is illegal in many jurisdictions. Always get permission.
- âš ï¸ **Accents and noise**: STT accuracy drops significantly with heavy accents, background noise, or domain jargon. Test with real users.
- âš ï¸ **Cost**: Voice tokens are more expensive than text tokens. Budget carefully for voice applications.

---

## ○ Interview Angles

- **Q**: How would you build a real-time voice AI agent?
- **A**: Option 1 (simplest): OpenAI Realtime API â€” WebSocket-based, speech-to-speech, handles turn-taking and interruptions natively. Option 2 (customizable): Pipeline of Deepgram STT → LLM (with function calling for tools) → ElevenLabs TTS, with a VAD layer for turn management. Option 3 (Google ecosystem): ADK + Gemini Live for multi-agent voice systems. Key challenges: latency optimization, interruption handling, and graceful error recovery.

## ◆ Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Build a Voice-to-Voice Pipeline

**Goal**: Create an end-to-end voice conversation system
**Time**: 45 minutes
**Steps**:
1. Set up STT (Whisper or Deepgram)
2. Connect to an LLM for response generation
3. Add TTS (ElevenLabs or Coqui) for audio output
4. Measure end-to-end latency for 5 conversation turns
