# Scaling Laws & Pre-training

> âœ¨ **Bit**: GPT-5.4 cost hundreds of millions of dollars to train. Not because the algorithm is complex â€” it's literally next-token prediction â€” but because you need ~25,000 GPUs running for months on trillions of tokens. The secret of LLMs is embarrassingly simple: scale.

---

## â˜… TL;DR

- **What**: The process of training an LLM from scratch on internet-scale data, and the mathematical laws predicting how performance improves with more compute, data, and parameters
- **Why**: Understanding pre-training explains WHY bigger models are better, HOW training costs scale, and WHEN to stop training â€” critical for anyone building or evaluating LLMs
- **Key point**: Chinchilla showed training a SMALLER model on MORE data beats a bigger model on less data. This insight reshaped the entire industry.

---

## â˜… Overview

### Definition

**Scaling laws** describe how model performance changes as compute, data, and parameter count increase. **Pre-training** is the large-scale learning phase where a model absorbs general patterns before later alignment or specialization.

### Scope

This note focuses on the economics, mechanics, and trade-offs of pre-training at scale. For the distributed systems layer behind these runs, see [Distributed Training for Large Models](../research-frontiers/distributed-training.md).

### Significance

- Scaling behavior explains why frontier labs invest so heavily in data, compute, and optimization.
- Pre-training remains the foundation beneath later techniques such as fine-tuning, RL alignment, and distillation.

### Scaling Laws

```
THE CORE INSIGHT (Kaplan et al., 2020):

  Model performance (loss) improves as a POWER LAW with:
    1. Number of parameters (N)
    2. Amount of training data (D)
    3. Amount of compute (C)

  L(C) âˆ C^(-0.05)  (loss decreases with compute)
  L(N) âˆ N^(-0.076) (loss decreases with parameters)
  L(D) âˆ D^(-0.095) (loss decreases with data)

  WHAT THIS MEANS:
  - 10x more compute â†’ predictable improvement
  - Returns diminish but NEVER stop (no plateau found yet)
  - You can PREDICT a model's quality before training it
```

### Chinchilla Scaling (DeepMind, 2022)

```
THE GAME-CHANGER:

  OpenAI's approach (2020-2022): "Make models BIGGER"
    GPT-3: 175B params, trained on 300B tokens
    Bigger model, less data â†’ expensive inference

  DeepMind's Chinchilla finding:
    "For a given compute budget, you should train a
     SMALLER model on MORE data"

  THE RULE:
    Optimal tokens â‰ˆ 20 Ã— parameters

    Model Size    â”‚ Optimal Data | GPT-3 Used | Chinchilla
    â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
    10B params    â”‚ 200B tokens  â”‚ (N/A)      â”‚ âœ“
    70B params    â”‚ 1.4T tokens  â”‚ 300B (!)   â”‚ âœ— undertrained
    175B params   â”‚ 3.5T tokens  â”‚ 300B (!)   â”‚ âœ— MASSIVELY undertrained

  IMPACT:
    GPT-3 was 10x undertrained by this rule!
    LLaMA (Meta, 2023): 65B model trained on 1.4T tokens
      â†’ Matched GPT-3 175B with 3x fewer parameters!

  POST-CHINCHILLA (2024-2026):
    Industry shifted to "over-training" small models:
    Train way beyond the Chinchilla-optimal point
    because inference cost matters more than training cost.

    LLaMA 3 8B: trained on 15T tokens (1875Ã— params!)
    Reason: Train once (expensive), run forever (cheap)
```

### Training Infrastructure

```
HARDWARE (2025-2026 training runs):

  GPU: NVIDIA H100 (80GB) â†’ H200 (141GB) â†’ B200/GB300

  Typical cluster:
    GPT-5.x training:    ~25,000+ H100s
    LLaMA 4:             ~16,000 H100s
    Gemini 3.x:          TPU v5p pods (~10,000+ chips)
    DeepSeek-R1:         ~2,000 H100s (cost-efficient!)

  PARALLELISM STRATEGIES:
    Data Parallel:     Same model on each GPU, different data
    Tensor Parallel:   Split layers WITHIN GPUs (same node)
    Pipeline Parallel: Split layers ACROSS GPUs (different nodes)
    Expert Parallel:   MoE experts on different GPUs
    FSDP:             Fully Sharded Data Parallel (PyTorch)

  NETWORKING:
    NVLink:      GPU-to-GPU within node (900 GB/s)
    InfiniBand:  Node-to-node (400 Gb/s per port)
    Critical: Training large models is often NETWORK-bound

  COST EXAMPLES (approximate, 2025-2026):
    LLaMA 3 70B:     ~$10M
    GPT-5 family:    ~$200M-$500M+
    Gemini 3.x:      ~$100M+ (TPU costs differ)
    DeepSeek-R1:     ~$5M (remarkably cost-efficient)
```

### Training Challenges

```
COMMON FAILURES:
  1. Loss spikes:    Sudden jumps in loss, often from bad data
                     Fix: restart from last checkpoint, skip bad batch

  2. Gradient issues: NaN gradients, exploding/vanishing
                     Fix: gradient clipping, learning rate warmup

  3. Hardware failures: GPUs die during months-long training
                     Fix: aggressive checkpointing, auto-restart

  4. Data contamination: Benchmark data leaks into training set
                     Fix: careful deduplication, held-out evaluation

  5. Instability at scale: Training becomes chaotic at 100B+ params
                     Fix: bf16 precision, Î¼P (maximal update parametrization)
```

## â—† Quick Reference

```
SCALING RULES OF THUMB:
  Chinchilla:     tokens â‰ˆ 20Ã— parameters (compute-optimal)
  Over-training:  tokens â‰ˆ 100-2000Ã— params (inference-optimal)
  10Ã— compute:    ~5% loss reduction (reliable)

TRAINING COST COMPONENTS:
  GPU hours:       60-80% of total cost
  Networking:      10-15%
  Storage:         5-10%
  Engineering:     10-15% (often underestimated)

PRE-TRAINING OBJECTIVE:
  Next-token prediction: P(token_t | token_1, ..., token_{t-1})
  That's it. This single objective produces all LLM capabilities.
```

## â—‹ Interview Angles

- **Q**: Explain the Chinchilla scaling laws.
- **A**: For a fixed compute budget, there's an optimal ratio of model size to training data. Chinchilla showed the optimal is ~20 tokens per parameter. GPT-3 (175B params, 300B tokens) was massively undertrained â€” a 70B model on 1.4T tokens would match it. This led to LLaMA's approach: smaller models, much more data. In 2025-2026, industry "over-trains" beyond Chinchilla-optimal because inference cost (running the model) matters more than training cost (one-time).

- **Q**: How is a large language model pre-trained?
- **A**: (1) Collect trillions of tokens from internet, books, code. (2) Clean and deduplicate aggressively. (3) Train a BPE tokenizer. (4) Set data mix ratios (web, code, books, math). (5) Train using next-token prediction on 10K-100K GPUs for 2-6 months using distributed parallelism (data, tensor, pipeline). (6) Monitor loss curves, handle spikes, checkpoint regularly. Cost: $10M-$500M+ per run.

    params: model parameters (e.g. 7e9 for 7B)
    Returns: Chinchilla-optimal token count and FLOPs estimate
    """
    tokens_optimal = 20 * params          # Chinchilla rule
    flops_estimate = 6 * params * tokens_optimal  # ~6 * N * D for transformer training

    r = chinchilla_optimal(params)
    print(
        f"{model_name:<18} | {r['params_B']:>6.1f}B params | "
        f"optimal: {r['tokens_B']:>6.0f}B tokens | "
        f"{r['flops_e21']:.1f}e21 FLOPs"
    )

# Note: Modern models (LLaMA 3, Gemma 3) over-train by 5-10x for better
# inference efficiency â€” Chinchilla is the floor, not the ceiling.
