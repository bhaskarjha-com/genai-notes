# Reasoning Models & Test-Time Compute

> ✨ **Bit**: Pre-2024: "Make the model bigger to make it smarter." Post-2024: "Make the model THINK LONGER to make it smarter." This shift â€” from scaling training compute to scaling inference compute â€” is the biggest paradigm change since the Transformer.

---

## ★ TL;DR

- **What**: LLMs that generate internal "thinking" chains before answering, trading more inference compute for dramatically better reasoning
- **Why**: Standard LLMs fail at complex math, logic, and multi-step problems. Reasoning models solve these by "thinking step by step" internally â€” not as a prompting trick, but as a trained capability
- **Key point**: o1/o3/DeepSeek-R1 represent a new scaling law â€” **test-time compute scaling** â€” where spending more compute at inference yields better answers, sometimes surpassing even larger standard models

---

## ★ Overview

### Definition

**Reasoning models** are LLMs specifically trained (usually via reinforcement learning) to produce extended chains of internal reasoning before generating a final answer. Unlike standard LLMs that generate responses token-by-token in one pass, reasoning models generate a hidden "thinking" block where they plan, verify, backtrack, and self-correct.

### Scope

Covers: Reasoning model architectures, test-time compute scaling, process reward models, and when to use reasoning vs standard models. For basic prompting techniques (zero-shot CoT), see [Prompt Engineering](../techniques/prompt-engineering.md). For standard LLM overview, see [Llms Overview](./llms-overview.md).

Last verified for model-lineup and timeline references: 2026-04.

### Significance

- o1 (Sep 2024) proved reasoning models can solve PhD-level problems standard LLMs can't
- DeepSeek-R1 (Jan 2025) showed open-source reasoning is viable
- This is the #1 interview topic for frontier GenAI roles in 2025-2026
- Fundamentally changes when to use "bigger model" vs "more thinking time"

### Prerequisites

## ★ Deep Dive

### The Two Scaling Laws

```
ERA 1: PRE-TRAINING SCALING (2020-2024)
  "Make the model bigger, train on more data"

  Performance âˆ model_size Ã— data_size Ã— training_compute

  GPT-3 (175B) → GPT-4 (~1.8T) → GPT-5 (~1T+)
  Problem: Diminishing returns. 10x compute → ~1.5x better.
  Cost: $100M+ per training run.

ERA 2: TEST-TIME COMPUTE SCALING (2024+)
  "Let the model think longer on hard problems"

  Performance âˆ inference_compute (thinking tokens)

  Small model + 100 thinking tokens → beats large model on reasoning
  Cost: Pay per-problem (harder problems = more tokens = more cost)

  KEY INSIGHT: You can DYNAMICALLY allocate compute per problem.
  Easy question → fast answer. Hard math → 10 minutes of thinking.

  THE SCALING CEILING: Test-time compute scaling is bounded by the model's ability to verify its own logic (the verification-generation gap). If verifying a step is as hard as generating it, inference scaling flatlines. Furthermore, massive thinking chains lead to KV cache exhaustion on GPUs.
```

### How Reasoning Models Work

```
STANDARD LLM:
  User: "What is 27 Ã— 34?"
  Model: "918" â† Direct answer (often wrong for harder math)
  Tokens: ~5

REASONING MODEL:
  User: "What is 27 Ã— 34?"

  [THINKING â€” hidden from user]
  "I need to multiply 27 Ã— 34.
   Let me break this down:
   27 Ã— 34 = 27 Ã— 30 + 27 Ã— 4
   27 Ã— 30 = 810
   27 Ã— 4 = 108
   810 + 108 = 918
   Let me verify: 918 / 27 = 34 âœ“"
  [/THINKING]

  Model: "918" â† Same answer, but verified
  Tokens: ~80 (thinking) + 5 (answer)
```

### DeepSeek-R1: The Open-Source Breakthrough

```
WHY IT MATTERS:
  - Open-weight reasoning model competitive with o1
  - Showed reasoning can emerge from pure RL (no supervised data!)
  - "Aha moment": During training, the model spontaneously started
    re-evaluating and self-correcting â€” emergent reasoning behavior

TRAINING APPROACH (GRPO):
  Group Relative Policy Optimization
  - Generate multiple solutions in parallel
  - Rank them against each other (group-relative, not absolute)
  - No separate reward model needed
  - Simpler and cheaper than PPO

DISTILLED VERSIONS:
  DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B
  → Distill R1's reasoning into smaller models
  → Available via Ollama for local use

## ◆ Code & Implementation

```python
# âš ï¸ Last tested: 2026-04
# â•â•â• Using OpenAI o3 â•â•â•
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="o3",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Prove that âˆš2 is irrational."
    }],
    # Reasoning models handle CoT internally
    # No need for "think step by step" prompts
    # reasoning_effort="high"  # low/medium/high â€” controls thinking depth
)

# The response includes the final answer
# Thinking tokens are consumed but hidden by default
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
print(f"Total tokens: {response.usage.total_tokens}")
# → Much higher token count due to internal reasoning

# â•â•â• Using DeepSeek-R1 locally via Ollama â•â•â•
# ollama run deepseek-r1:8b
# The model outputs <think>...</think> blocks visibly
```

## ◆ Quick Reference

```
REASONING MODEL DECISION TREE:
  Is the task complex reasoning/math/logic?
    YES → Use reasoning model (o3, DeepSeek-R1)
    NO  → Use standard LLM (GPT-5.4, Claude Sonnet 4.6)

  Is latency critical?
    YES → Use standard LLM or GPT-5.4 mini
    NO  → Reasoning model is fine

  Is cost critical?
    YES → GPT-5.4 mini or DeepSeek-R1 (open, self-host)
    NO  → o3 with high reasoning effort

KEY NUMBERS:
  o1 on AIME 2024: 83% (vs GPT-4o: 13%)
  o3 on ARC-AGI: 87.5% (vs GPT-4o: ~5%)
  DeepSeek-R1 on MATH-500: 97.3%

  Thinking tokens: 500-50,000+ per problem
  Cost: 2-20x more than standard models per query
```

## ○ Gotchas & Common Mistakes

- âš ï¸ **Don't prompt "think step by step"**: Reasoning models already do this internally. Adding CoT prompts can actually hurt performance.
- âš ï¸ **KV Cache Explosion & Cost Surprise**: A single complex query can consume 50K+ tokens of thinking. Because reasoning models autoregressively output and attend to these hidden tokens, the KV cache grows massive during test-time compute. This forces dynamic PagedAttention management and huge API costs. Monitor token economics ruthlessly.
- âš ï¸ **Latency**: Thinking takes time. A hard math problem might take 30-60 seconds. Not suitable for real-time chat.
- âš ï¸ **Not always better**: For simple tasks, reasoning models waste compute and can overthink. Use standard models for simple tasks.
- âš ï¸ **Hidden thinking â‰  explainable**: You see the answer but not always the reasoning (o1/o3 hide thinking by default).

---

## ○ Interview Angles

- **Q**: What is test-time compute scaling and why does it matter?
- **A**: Instead of scaling model size (pre-training compute), you scale compute at inference â€” let the model "think longer" on harder problems. This is more efficient because you allocate compute per-problem (easy = cheap, hard = expensive) rather than baking it all into a massive model. o1/o3 showed this can match or exceed much larger standard models.

- **Q**: How is DeepSeek-R1 trained?
- **A**: Uses GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization). Generate multiple reasoning chains for a problem, rank them group-relatively, and reinforce better paths. Remarkably, reasoning behavior (self-correction, re-evaluation) emerged purely from RL without supervised reasoning data.

- **Q**: When would you NOT use a reasoning model?
- **A**: Simple tasks (chat, translation, summarization), latency-critical applications (real-time), cost-sensitive high-volume scenarios, and creative tasks where "thinking" adds no value. Reasoning models are for problems where correct step-by-step logic matters.

## ◆ Production Failure Modes

| Failure | Symptoms | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|------------|------------|
| **Thinking token explosion** | Reasoning model uses 10K+ thinking tokens on simple questions | No complexity routing, all queries sent to reasoning model | Classify complexity first, route simple queries to base model |
| **False reasoning chains** | Plausible-sounding but logically invalid reasoning | Chain-of-thought doesn't guarantee logical validity | Verification step, structured output for checkable steps |
| **Latency unacceptable** | 15-30 second response times | Test-time compute inherently slow | Streaming partial results, speculative execution, caching |
| **Cost 10x vs base model** | Reasoning model costs overwhelm budget | Using o1-level model for all queries | Tiered model selection, reasoning only for complex queries |

---

## ◆ Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Build a Complexity Router

**Goal**: Route queries to reasoning vs non-reasoning models based on complexity
**Time**: 30 minutes
**Steps**:
1. Create 20 queries spanning simple factual to complex multi-step reasoning
2. Build a lightweight classifier (LLM-as-judge or heuristic) for complexity
3. Route simple queries to GPT-4o-mini and complex to o3-mini
4. Compare cost vs quality with and without routing
**Expected Output**: 50-70% cost reduction with <5% quality drop on simple queries
