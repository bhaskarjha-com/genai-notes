# Data Flywheel Design

> âœ¨ **Bit**: The best AI systems don't just answer questions â€” they learn from every interaction. A data flywheel turns user feedback, corrections, and behavioral signals into training data that makes the system better, which attracts more users, generating more data. This is the moat.

---

## â˜… TL;DR

- **What**: A self-reinforcing loop where user interactions generate data that improves the AI system, which improves user experience, generating more data
- **Why**: Static AI systems degrade over time as user needs evolve. Flywheels create compounding improvement â€” the competitive advantage that separates products from prototypes.
- **Key point**: The flywheel has 4 stages: collect signals â†’ curate data â†’ improve model/retrieval â†’ measure impact â†’ repeat.

## â˜… Overview

### Definition

A **data flywheel** is a self-reinforcing system where product usage generates data that improves the AI, which improves the product, driving more usage and more data.

### Scope

Covers: Flywheel architecture, signal collection (implicit/explicit), data curation pipelines, improvement strategies (fine-tuning, retrieval, prompts), and measurement. For evaluation, see [LLM Evaluation](../evaluation/llm-evaluation-deep-dive.md). For synthetic data, see [Synthetic Data](../techniques/synthetic-data-and-data-engineering.md).

### Prerequisites

- [Monitoring & Observability](./monitoring-observability.md)
- [LLM Evaluation Deep Dive](../evaluation/llm-evaluation-deep-dive.md)
- [Fine-Tuning](../techniques/fine-tuning.md)

```
IMPROVEMENT TARGETS (ordered by ease and impact):

  1. PROMPT REFINEMENT        â† Easiest, fastest
     Use failures to improve system prompts
     Timeline: days
     
  2. RETRIEVAL QUALITY        â† High ROI
     Add user-validated docs to corpus
     Fix chunking for failed retrievals
     Timeline: days-weeks
     
  3. EXAMPLE CURATION         â† Medium effort
     Add successful interactions as few-shot examples
     Timeline: weeks
     
  4. EMBEDDING FINE-TUNING    â† Moderate effort
     Fine-tune embeddings on domain query-doc pairs
     Timeline: weeks
     
  5. MODEL FINE-TUNING        â† Highest effort, highest impact
     Train on curated (input, ideal_output) pairs
     Timeline: months

## â˜… Code & Implementation

### Feedback Collection Pipeline

```python
# pip install fastapi>=0.110 sqlalchemy>=2.0
# âš ï¸ Last tested: 2026-04 | Requires: fastapi>=0.110

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional
import json

app = FastAPI()

# Simple in-memory store (use PostgreSQL in production)
feedback_store: list[dict] = []

class FeedbackSignal(BaseModel):
    request_id: str
    signal_type: str  # "thumbs_up", "thumbs_down", "edit", "regenerate"
    user_query: str
    ai_response: str
    user_correction: Optional[str] = None  # For edit signals
    metadata: dict = {}

@app.post("/v1/feedback")
async def collect_feedback(feedback: FeedbackSignal):
    """Collect user feedback signals for the data flywheel."""
    record = {
        **feedback.model_dump(),
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    }
    feedback_store.append(record)
    return {"status": "recorded", "request_id": feedback.request_id}

@app.get("/v1/flywheel/training-candidates")
async def get_training_candidates(min_quality: str = "high"):
    """Extract high-quality training pairs from feedback."""
    candidates = []
    for f in feedback_store:
        # User corrections are the highest-quality training data
        if f["signal_type"] == "edit" and f["user_correction"]:
            candidates.append({
                "input": f["user_query"],
                "ideal_output": f["user_correction"],
                "source": "user_correction",
                "quality": "very_high",
            })
        # Thumbs-up responses are good training examples
        elif f["signal_type"] == "thumbs_up":
            candidates.append({
                "input": f["user_query"],
                "ideal_output": f["ai_response"],
                "source": "user_approved",
                "quality": "high",
            })
    return {"candidates": candidates, "total": len(candidates)}

# Expected: POST /v1/feedback collects signals
# GET /v1/flywheel/training-candidates extracts curated pairs
```

## â—† Production Failure Modes

| Failure | Symptoms | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|------------|------------|
| **Feedback bias** | Model optimizes for vocal minority | Only power users give feedback, skewing data | Sample from all user segments, weight by usage patterns |
| **Flywheel stall** | Quality plateaus after initial improvement | Easy wins captured, remaining failures are harder | Segment failures by category, target each systematically |
| **Data poisoning** | Quality degrades after training on user data | Adversarial or low-quality feedback incorporated | Validation layer before training, human review for corrections |
| **Metric gaming** | Thumbs-up rate increases but real quality doesn't | Users habituated to clicking thumbs-up, not evaluating | Use multiple signals, correlate with downstream task success |

---

## â—‹ Interview Angles

- **Q**: How would you build a system that improves from user feedback?
- **A**: I'd design a 4-stage data flywheel. Stage 1: Collect both explicit signals (thumbs up/down, user edits) and implicit signals (regeneration, session abandonment) from every interaction. Stage 2: Curate â€” user corrections become the highest-quality training data; thumbs-up responses become positive examples; thumbs-down + regeneration patterns reveal failure modes. Stage 3: Improve iteratively â€” start with prompt refinements (days), then retrieval improvements (weeks), then embedding fine-tuning (weeks), then model fine-tuning quarterly. Stage 4: Measure impact with A/B tests â€” compare flywheel-improved version vs control. I'd target 2-5% quality improvement per month, compounding over time.

## â—† Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Design a Flywheel for a Support Chatbot

**Goal**: Design the full data collection and improvement pipeline
**Time**: 30 minutes
**Steps**:
1. List all signals you'd collect (at least 5 explicit + 5 implicit)
2. Design the data curation pipeline (which signals â†’ which training data)
3. Prioritize 3 improvement actions for month 1, 3, and 6
4. Define success metrics for each stage
**Expected Output**: Flywheel architecture diagram with metrics plan
